## Contributions
Code contributions should be made using the `develop` branch. First create a new branch off of `develop`. Then, when ready, create a pull request to merge the changes back into `develop`. Please use descriptive titles and include summaries in the description if necessary.

Opening new issues with bug reports or feature requests is also a very welcome way to contribute. Please label new issues appropriately.
